### Global Affairs: A Week of Shifting Sands & Stalled Talks

#### Diplomacy
- Germany, France, and Great Britain have jointly urged Israel to restore humanitarian access to Gaza, expressing horror at civilian casualties and demanding an immediate ceasefire. They also called for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
- Negotiations are planned in Saudi Arabia, but a military analyst suggests both Ukraine and Russia approach them insincerely, aiming to deflect blame for potential failure onto the other side, particularly to influence Donald Trump.

#### Ukraine Conflict
- Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visited troops near the frontline in eastern Ukraine, including near Pokrovsk, a city under sustained Russian attack. While the frontline has stabilized somewhat, Russia has made gains in several areas.
- Ukraine’s recent offensive into the Kursk region of Russia ultimately failed to hold territory, prompting questions within Ukraine about the cost-benefit of the operation. A military analyst notes that while the offensive put pressure on Russia, it’s unlikely to be a significant negotiating chip.
- Both Ukraine and Russia believe time is on their side, diminishing the likelihood of a near-term peace agreement despite planned negotiations.

#### United States Domestic Politics
- The upcoming US presidential election is influencing the dynamics of the Ukraine conflict, with both Russia and Ukraine appearing to maneuver for favorable positioning with Donald Trump.
