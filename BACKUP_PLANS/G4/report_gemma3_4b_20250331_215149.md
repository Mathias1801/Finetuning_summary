- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops near Pokrovsk, assessing the operational situation and receiving reports on defense efforts.
- Despite a surprise offensive in the Kursk region earlier this year that briefly occupied a significant area of Russia, Ukrainian forces have been pushed back, and the offensive is now viewed as strategically unsuccessful.
- The frontline has stabilized, with both sides making incremental gains in specific areas, but neither side is achieving decisive breakthroughs.
- Zelenskyy visited memorials and posed for photos in Donetsk, while acknowledging the loss of soldier Pavlo, who remains missing in Kursk.

- A broader trend of security clearance revocations is underway, with President Trump targeting former officials.
- The conflict in Ukraine continues with no immediate resolution in sight, with both sides focusing on bolstering their positions and projecting an image of strength.
