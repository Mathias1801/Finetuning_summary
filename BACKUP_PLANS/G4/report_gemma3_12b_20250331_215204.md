### A Whirlwind of Politics and Peril

#### [Diplomacy]

*   Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, both former presidential candidates, have had their security clearances revoked by order of former U.S. President Donald Trump. The move, announced late Friday, also affects former Republican President Donald Trump and Ukrainian General Staff.
*   Ukraine and Russia are expected to send representatives to negotiations in Saudi Arabia, but both sides are reportedly reluctant and view the talks as a means to appear cooperative while believing time is on their side.
*   Both Ukraine and Russia are attempting to portray the other as unwilling to negotiate, potentially to appease former U.S. President Donald Trump and his potential peace project.

#### [Geopolitics/Ukraine-Russia Conflict]

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited frontline troops near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, acknowledging the challenging operational situation and Russian advances in several cities.
*   Russia has regained control of the Kursk region following a Ukrainian offensive that briefly occupied approximately 1,300 square kilometers of Russian territory, prompting questions about the offensive’s value and the fate of Ukrainian soldiers, including one reported missing.
*   Military analysts suggest that while Russia is making incremental gains, Ukraine’s offensive, despite setbacks, has achieved strategic goals by pressuring Russia and diverting troops from other fronts.
*   The frontline has largely stabilized, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces making localized advances.
